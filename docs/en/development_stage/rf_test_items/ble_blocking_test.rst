Bluetooth LE Blocking Test
==========================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The Bluetooth LE Blocking Test evaluates the stability and performance of a device in environments with interference from other wireless signals. It ensures the device meets relevant standards for interference resistance.

Test Methods for Bluetooth LE Blocking
--------------------------------------

The test can be performed in two modes:

1. **Non-signaling mode**

In this mode, a fixed frequency is selected to test the device's resistance to interference. For details, please refer to :doc:`./bt_ble_non_signaling_test`.

2. **Direct Test Mode (DTM)**

DTM mode allows low-level control of the device, enabling the introduction of interference signals to access its interference resistance. For details, please refer to :doc:`./ble_dtm_test`.
