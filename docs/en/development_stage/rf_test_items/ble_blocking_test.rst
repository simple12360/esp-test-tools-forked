Bluetooth LE Blocking Test
==========================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The Bluetooth LE Blocking Test assesses device stability and performance in environments with interference from other wireless signals, ensuring compliance with relevant standards.

Bluetooth LE Blocking Test Method
--------------------------------------

The Bluetooth LE Blocking Test can be conducted in a non-signaling (fixed frequency) mode, selecting a fixed frequency to test the device's interference resistance. For the test steps, please refer to :doc:`./bt_ble_non_signaling_test`.

The Bluetooth LE Blocking Test can also be conducted through DTM mode, which allows for low-level control of the device, facilitating the introduction of interference signals to evaluate the device's interference resistance. For the test steps, please refer to :doc:`./ble_dtm_test`.
