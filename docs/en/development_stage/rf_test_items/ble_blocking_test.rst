Bluetooth LE Blocking Test
=================================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The Bluetooth LE Blocking Test is primarily used to evaluate the performance and stability of wireless devices in environments with other wireless signal interference, ensuring compliance with relevant standards. This test is mainly used for CE certification.

Bluetooth LE Blocking Test Method
--------------------------------------

The Bluetooth LE Blocking Test can be conducted in a non-signaling (fixed frequency) mode, selecting a fixed frequency to test the device's interference resistance. For the test steps, please refer to :doc:`./bt_ble_non_signaling_test`.

The Bluetooth LE Blocking Test can also be conducted through DTM mode, which allows for low-level control of the device, facilitating the introduction of interference signals to evaluate the device's interference resistance. For the test steps, please refer to :doc:`./ble_dtm_test`.
