SRRC Certification
==================

The SRRC (State Radio Regulatory Commission) certification is a mandatory certification in China for radio devices. This certification ensures that radio devices comply with laws and technical standards, preventing interference with the electromagnetic environment and other radio devices. Only products with SRRC certification can be legally sold and used in China.
